# Logistic Regression

The dataset comes from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/loan-default-dataset) which is a loan approval dataset (1 if approved, 0 if denied) and based 
on other exploratory variables. 

We are mainly interested in predicting loan approval rates through a binary logistic regression model made in R. Interactions were also tackled here and how it compares to the non-interactive model through metrics such as the ROC-AUC curve.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) has already been done, which is evidenced in the attached Excel File.
